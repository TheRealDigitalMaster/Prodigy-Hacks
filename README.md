# Prodigy Hacks

##What are Bookmarklets?

Bookmarklets are small programs, saved as bookmarks in a web browser, that can perform specific functions on a web page. They are essentially a set of JavaScript functions that can manipulate the page you are currently viewing. To use a bookmarklet, you simply click on the bookmarklet link in your browser's bookmarks bar while viewing a web page. The bookmarklet can perform a wide range of tasks, such as resizing images, highlighting text, or translating a page. In our case, we are using them to hack prodigy.

##How to use the bookmarklets?

1. Create a new bookmark: Right-click on your browser's bookmark bar and select "Add Page" or "Add Bookmark." Give your bookmark a descriptive name that indicates what it does.

3. Copy the bookmarklet code from the github repo: Highlight the bookmarklet and copy it to your clipboard.

4. Edit the bookmark properties: Right-click on the newly created bookmark and select "Edit" or "Properties." Replace the URL with the bookmarklet code you just copied and save the changes.

5. Use the bookmarklet: (Prodigy X) Go to prodigy. Once logged in, click on the bookmarklet on your bookmark bar. After a few seconds you should see a drop down menu on the top left corner of your game. (Free Membership) Go to prodigy. Once logged in, click on the bookmarklet on your bookmark bar. You should see the member tag on your username. You will now be able to buy member only houses and open member chests. (Skip Tutorial) Go to prodigy. Once signed up, DON'T click on the bookmarklet on your bookmark bar just yet. Once you leave your house, then you can click on the bookmarklet. But when you reload the page and log back in, the game will choose a random name for you. So to fix this you click on the Prodigy X bookmarklet, and go to the 'Change Name'. Not 'Set Name'. Then you can change your name.


Have fun :)
